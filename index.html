    <div class="selfIntroText">I am a research assistant in Academia Sinica. My research interests include the ecological causes and consequences of cooperation. My approach is mainly theoretical and combines evolutionary dynamics. For my MS, I studied the relationships among resource availability, intraspecific cooperation, and population dynamics. Now I am examining how spatiotemporal environmental variations and geometry influence the evolution of cooperative investment in different types of grouping benefits.</div>

    <div class="researchIntro">I have always been focusing my attention on how environmental conditions influence the evolution of cooperation and how intraspecific cooperation and environmental conditions jointly influence the ecological consequences of populations, such as range size and population size.<p><b>Ecological causes of sociality</b><br>Environmental conditions can be delineated into several parts, such as mean of environmental conditions, spatiotemporal variations, and spatial distributions of microhabitats (or patches) of different quality, which have distict impacts on social evolution. In addition, social animals form groups for different ecological reasons, thus being favored under distinct environmental conditions. I have found that social populations with collective action benefits, which cooperate to increase group activities, are more cooperative in harsh and unpredictable environments, whereas social populations with resource defense benefits, which defend critical resources against outsiders, are more cooperative in benign and stable environments.<p><b>Ecological consequences of sociality</b><br>Different types of grouping benefits can have distinct ecological consequences and, therefore, provide testable predictions to distinguish these alternative mechanisms of group formation, especially at inter-specific comparative levels where conducting careful experimental manipulations is nearly impossible. Since collective action benefits help organisms cope with environmental challenges or interspecific competition, sociality is predicted to enable individuals to overcome a variety of environmental challenges, which help expand their ecological niche and distribution ranges size in the face of harsh and fluctuating environments or severe inter-specific competition. In contrast, resource defense benefits are mainly derived from competing with conspecifics rather than with other environmental challenges, so cooperation should have little impact on the niche breadth and/or distribution ranges size of social species that form groups for this reason.</div>
